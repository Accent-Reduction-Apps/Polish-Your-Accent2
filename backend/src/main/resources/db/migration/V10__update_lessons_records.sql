    text = '<p>The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is an alphabetic system of phonetic notation based primarily on the Latin script. It was devised by the International Phonetic Association in the late 19th century as a standardized representation of speech sounds in written form. The IPA is used by lexicographers, foreign language students and teachers, linguists, speech–language pathologists, singers, actors, constructed language creators, and translators. The IPA is designed to represent those qualities of speech that are part of lexical (and, to a limited extent, prosodic) sounds in oral language: phones, phonemes, intonation, and the separation of words and syllables. To represent additional qualities of speech—such as tooth gnashing, lisping, and sounds made with a cleft lip and cleft palate—an extended set of symbols may be used. Segments are transcribed by one or more IPA symbols of two basic types: letters and diacritics. For example, the sound of the English letter ⟨t⟩ may be transcribed in IPA with 		a single letter: [t], or with a letter plus diacritics: [t̺ʰ], depending on how precise one wishes to be. Slashes are used to signal phonemic transcription; therefore, /t/ is more abstract than either [t̺ʰ] or [t] and might refer to either, depending on the context and language. Occasionally, letters or diacritics are added, removed, or modified by the International Phonetic Association. As of the most recent change in 2005,[4] there are 107 segmental letters, an indefinitely large number of suprasegmental letters, 44 diacritics (not counting composites), and four extra-lexical prosodic marks in the IPA. Most of these are shown in the current IPA chart, posted below in this article and at the website of the IPA </p>'

    text = '<p>Although the table above is very useful, memorizing it would be very difficult. But don’t worry, almost nobody does. The fastest way to learn English phonetics and how to pronounce words is by listening. If the audios you find online seem boring and unpleasant, we recommend watching the original version of American or British TV shows with subtitles so you can understand them. Another option is listening to podcasts that interest you to familiarize yourself with English pronunciation, which isn’t the most difficult of the languages. If you have the opportunity, have conversations with native speakers to quickly familiarize your ear to the language and adjust your pronunciation. With patience and practice, you’ll get to where you want to be.</p>'
